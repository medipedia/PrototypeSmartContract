# Medipedia Platform Prototype

### Snapshot
Medipedia released it's POC or prototype of the platform in July 2018. POC provides a platform where a patient can search matching doctors for a specific treatment. Patient sends a medical request for his or her specific treatment and request is sent to all the matched doctors. Doctors can reply to patient's medical request. This POC has enabled a decentralized messaging system between patients and doctors. 

All message communications between doctors and patients are encrypted at the user's end and encrypted content is stored in IPFS. IPFS creates a hash value of the encrypted content and the same hash value is stored in the ethereum blockchain.
Contract is developed using Ethereum smart contract standard in solidity language and it is deployed in Ropsten network of Ethereum blockchain.

We have decided to launch Medipdia alpha platform in EOS Blockchain after EOS launched their Main network in June 2018. EOS has many benefits over Ethereum blockchain such as no transaction fee, faster transaction, application can scale due to increase in number users etc.
